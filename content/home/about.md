# What I do:

I work as a consultant data scientist - mostly in credit scoring 
(predictive modelling of retail customer behaviour in consumer finance).
Since 1989 I have worked in this area with a variety of vendor and client organisations 
on project work and R&D of products and services. 
During that time I have worked on a wide range of topics, including:
application and behaviour scoring, collection scoring, profitability modelling, Basel II modelling, 
fraud detection, and entity resolution (approximate identity matching).
I tend to use a range of non-standard modelling techniques (for credit scoring),
but always hold pragmatism as more important than technical virtuosity 
when applied to systems that make millions of automated decisions.
In credit scoring and related areas the most important modelling question is
"What could possibly go wrong?" applied broadly to cover the technical, operational, and ethical aspects.

I am also an independent researcher in cognitive science, 
having held adjunct positions at the University of Melbourne and La Trobe University.
This research revolves around Vector Symbolic Architectures - 
computational systems based on very high dimensional dynamic systems,
which can be implemented as neural networks
and can be thought of as analog computers for manipulating discrete data structures such as trees and graphs.
This research is aimed at developing a practical, implementable, connectionist architecture for compositional memory. 
Such a memory system would have the ability to recognise novel situations and objects 
in terms of the novel pattern of structural relationships between their familiar component parts. 
This work effectively treats analogy as a primitive capability of memory. 
Current standard machine-learning techniques have limited capacity to deal with patterns of relationships 
and consequently have difficulty recognising novel configurations of familiar components 
or recognising familiar patterns of relationship when the components have been changed.
If successful, this work will have fundamental implications for cognitive science.
