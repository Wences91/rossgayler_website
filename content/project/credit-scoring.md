[Credit scoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score) 
is predictive modelling of customer behaviours relevant to lending in retail finance.
The retail finance aspect means that there are very many borrowers (unlike corporate or institutional lending)
and that, consequently, decision-making tends to be automated.

This project is a place-holder for any work related to credit scoring that is not allocated to a more specific project.
