<p>One of the side-effects of working in credit-scoring,
and especially working for a credit bureau,
is that you tend to become <em>very</em> concerned about privacy issues.</p>
<p>This website is implemented in <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>
using the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> static website generator
and the <a href="https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic">Academic</a> theme.
When I launched the website,
just before
the EU <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>
came into force,
the implementation tools provided some basic GDPR support.
Since then, some more privacy-related features have been added -
so I feel obliged to add them to my site.
(Besides which, this gives me an opportunity to practise updating my infrastructure.)</p>

<h2>Update the Hugo version</h2>
<p>Hugo has introduced new, more
<a href="https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/">fine-grained privacy configuration</a>
since version <code>0.41</code>.
So, the first step is to update my Hugo installation
and the <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> deploy process that depends on it.
Luckily, Mara Averick has a blog post precisely on
<a href="https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2017/10/updating-blogdown-hugo-version-netlify/">“updating your version of Hugo for blogdown on Netlify”</a>.</p>
<p>So, stepping through:</p>
<ul>
<li>What version of Hugo am I using now?</li>
</ul>
<pre><code># from R
&gt; blogdown::hugo_version()
[1] ‘0.40.3’</code></pre>
<p>The curent version of Hugo as I write is <a href="https://gohugo.io/news/0.42.2-relnotes/"><code>0.42.2</code></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Updating Hugo from R is as simple as:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>&gt; blogdown::update_hugo()
The latest Hugo version is 0.42.2
trying URL &#39;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.42.2/hugo_0.42.2_Linux-64bit.tar.gz&#39;

Hugo has been installed to /home/ross/bin</code></pre>
<p>The other thing credit scoring tends to do is reinforce your paranoid tendencies.
So, I’ll check the installed version again.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; blogdown::hugo_version()
[1] ‘0.42.2’</code></pre>
<p>So far I have updated Hugo for the website build that happens
on my local machine.
However, the website is deployed by Netlify,
which rebuilds the website remotely
from the source files in my <a href="https://github.com/rgayler/rossgayler_website">GitHub repo</a>.
So I also need to tell Netlify to use the same version of Hugo.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the Netlify HUGO_VERSION build environment variable</li>
</ul>
<p>This is described in some more detail in Mara’s post</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy on Netlify</li>
</ul>
<p>I triggered a deploy on Netlify and the site was rebuilt
using the new version of Hugo.
This executed with no problems.
I presume that Hugo versions are kept backwards compatible.
If Hugo is every updated in a way that breaks backward-compatibility
then the local version of the site would need to be modified
to be compatible with the new Hugo version
and then pushed to the GitHub repo
before the remote site was rebuilt on Netlify</p>

<div id="configure-the-hugo-privacy-settings" class="section level2">
<h2>Configure the Hugo privacy settings</h2>
<p>Hugo now provides more fine-grained control
of <a href="https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/#all-privacy-settings">privacy settings</a>.
So I need to incorporate them into my site.</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy the new Hugo privacy settings into my local <code>config.toml</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t really understand TOML, s
o I find the safest way to add text to <code>config.toml</code>
is to append it to the existing file.
This avoids problems when inserting a table that can be arbitrarily long,
because there is following pre-existing text
that can be accidentally parsed as part of the inserted table.</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the privacy settings</li>
</ul>
<p>I edited the newly added text in <code>config.toml</code>
to disable all services except Google Analytics
and set the Google Analytics options to the more privacy-preserving alternatives.
Once again, I don’t understand how these services interact with the Hugo-generated website,
so I presume the most conservative option is to disable them.</p>
<p>Also, the <code>config.toml</code> supplied with the Academic theme
contains the lines:</p>
<pre><code>  # Privacy pack
  #   Show a cookie consent message to visitors
  #   Anonymize IP in Google Analytics (if enabled)
  privacy_pack = true</code></pre>
<p>And the newly edited <code>config.toml</code> code from Hugo
contains the lines:</p>
<pre><code>[privacy]
  [privacy.googleAnalytics]
    anonymizeIP = true
    disable = false
    respectDoNotTrack = true
    useSessionStorage = false</code></pre>
<p>There is obviously some overlap of the two
with respect to anonymization of IP addresses for Google Analytics.
Once again, I don’t know how these are implemented
but I presume that if they both agree that IP adresses
should be anonymized,
then that is what will happen.</p>

<div id="update-the-academic-theme" class="section level2">
<h2>Update the Academic theme</h2>
<p><a href="https://georgecushen.com/">George Cushen</a>,
the author of the Acxademic theme,
has added functionality for having a
<a href="https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/537">customised privacy policy</a>.
To use this I need to update my installation
of the Academic theme.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/version-control.html">instructions for updating the theme framework</a>
in the Blogdown book.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the Academic theme</li>
</ul>
<p>I deleted the <code>themes/hugo-academic</code> folder
then added it as a Git submodule.</p>
</div>
<div id="update-the-privacy-policy-document" class="section level2">
<h2>Update the privacy policy document</h2>
<p>I added a customised privacy policy document (<code>privacy.md</code>)
by following <a href="https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/537">these instructions</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the privacy policy document</li>
</ul>
<p>And we’re done.
The website appears to be working as intended
and the new privacy policy is displayed
if the website visitor clicks the “Learn more” link.</p>
